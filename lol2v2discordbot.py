                    Generate 1 unique category for selecting champions for a League of Legends 2v2 ARAM game.
                    The category must be based on specific in-game mechanics, items, champion abilities, or team compositions.
                    Avoid vague or overly general names, be specific but its ok to sometimes be simple.
                    Also avoid anything to do with the league of legends rune system.

                    For example from the above list, 'Freljord' includes champions only from that part of Runeterra (e.g. Anivia, Ashe, Braum),
                    or 'High Risk' includes champs with high-risk, high-reward playstyles (Rengar, Qiyana, Irelia).
                    Structure your output to **only include the category name**, with a brief description in brackets (but dont include any champion names or abilities), and make it bold.
